## learning_VHDL_by_ourselves
this is a repo uploaded with just one objective, coordinate and organize the information, examples and programs created and modified while we learn VHDL

## How we are going to organize the repo

We are going to have three main folders :
```areash
repo_
    ├──_ ourPrograms (subfolder name example)
    |  ├── program_controllingLEDStrip (allways contains a readme.md)
    |  └── example_1_helloWorld (allways contains a readme.md)
    |   
    ├──_ documentationAndLinks (recordatory: [I'm an inline-style link] (https://www.pornhub.com), or : [I'm a relative reference to a repository file] (../blob/master/LICENSE))
    |  ├── interestingDocumentsLinks.md (links to a drive where we are going to save the files, documents and relevant info, links to videos explaining VHDL things go here too)    
    |  └── interestingExamplesLinks.md (links to interesting examples whatever format they are, including videos)    
    |
    └──_ programInstallationInfo (all info related to install VHDL suits for work, links to webpages and documents)
